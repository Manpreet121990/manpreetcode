Acura ADX

Acura is basing its new entry-level luxury SUV on the same global platform as the Honda HR-V and other models. But unlike the subcompact HR-V’s noisy and lackluster 2.0-liter four-cylinder, the ADX will use a more powerful 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine also found in the Integra sedan. The ADX will be offered in three trim levels, and all will be available with front- or all-wheel drive. In addition to the more luxurious interior, sport-tuned suspension, and stylish exterior, the ADX will feature a number of tweaks to keep the cabin quiet, addressing a problem we found with the HR-V. A full suite of standard active safety and driver assistance features rounds out that package.

 $35,000-$45,000 (estimated)

Audi A6 E-Tron

The Audi A6 E-Tron is a midsized four-door electric vehicle with a hatchback, similar in style to the automaker’s A5 and A7 Sportback models. It will be offered with three different powertrains when it goes on sale in 2025. The base version uses a 362-hp electric motor driving the rear wheels, while the all-wheel-drive E-Tron Quattro has two electric motors that combine to produce 422 hp. A high-performance AWD S6 version will produce 496 hp or 543 hp, with launch control. All models have a 100-kWh battery. The automaker says the car uses an 800-volt architecture, which allows it to have a 270-kW maximum acceptance rate at a public DC fast charger. The interior is dominated by large screens. An 11.9-inch one in front of the driver curves and blends into the 14.5-inch center touchscreen. An optional 10.9-inch display is available for the front passenger.

Audi has redesigned its Q5 luxury compact SUV for the 2025 model year, with evolutionary styling outside and a radical update inside. Two powertrains will be offered: a standard 268-hp, 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder in most versions or a 362-hp, 3.0-liter turbo V6 in the SQ5 performance trim. Both are mated to a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic and come standard with all-wheel drive. The interior is dominated by large screens. An 11.9-inch one in front of the driver curves and blends into the 14.5-inch center touchscreen. An optional 10.9-inch display is available for the front passenger. While all key safety systems come standard, the optional adaptive driving assistant plus uses different advanced driver assistance systems along with high-resolution map data and data from other vehicles to guide the Q5.

Redesigned for 2025, the fourth-generation X3 grows slightly in length and power, and it adopts a high-tech, minimalist interior design. It launches in two trims: 30 xDrive with a 255-hp, 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-four and M50 xDrive with a 393-hp, 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six engine. Each is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, augmented with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system, and employs all-wheel drive. The dash is dominated by a wide, curved display that houses the iDrive 9 infotainment system, available with numerous connected features. Among the notable upgrades is the ability for navigation instructions to be overlaid on the road ahead using the head-up display for augmented reality.

Buick Enclave

Redesigned for 2025, the Buick Enclave is again positioned as the upscale sibling to the new 
Chevrolet Traverse
 and 
GMC Acadia
. This three-row SUV makes notable advances in technology, with a massive 30-inch dash-mounted screen, a standard Bose audio system, and a robust suite of active safety features. Plus, it’s the first Buick with Super Cruise, GM’s hands-free active driving assistance system, and it’s fitted to all trim levels. The Enclave ditches the trusty 3.6-liter V6 for a 2.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. It’s again offered in front- and all-wheel drive. The top Avenir trim comes with an adaptive suspension.

Cadillac Escalade IQ

The Escalade IQ reinterprets the Escalade—a model long positioned as a flashy full-sized SUV—as a supersized electric SUV. Everything about this model is big and bold, from its exterior dimensions and giant dash display to its massive battery and prodigious power output. It measures about a foot longer than an Escalade, and it wears 24-inch wheels. The EV powertrain employs two motors, good for 750 hp, and a large 200-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery. It uses an 800-volt architecture, which facilitates pumping up to 100 miles of range in just 10 minutes in public DC fast chargers, the company says. The seven-seat SUV can be fitted with an optional Executive Second-Row package that turns passenger space into business class, with a stowable tray table, 12.6-inch screens, massaging seats, and more.

 $127,700-$175,000

Cadillac Vistiq

The Vistiq occupies the space between Cadillac’s two other electric SUVs—the midsized 2-row Lyriq and the full-sized Escalade IQ. Like the larger model, the Vistiq comes standard with a dual-motor electric drivetrain, albeit with less power, a lower 300-mile range, and a drastically smaller price. Stylistically, it features a rather conventional Cadillac SUV look adorned with a printed circuit board faux grille panel and some digitally inspired filigree printed on the rear quarter windows. It comes standard with Super Cruise, Cadillac’s impressive driver assistance technology that adds hands-free driving capability to the adaptive cruise control system. The second- and third-row seats can be folded for more cargo space, and there are storage spaces in the cargo floor and all four doors.

The next-generation Charger is offered in both coupe and sedan configurations, with a choice of electric or gas-only powertrains. The electric car is known as the Charger Daytona, and it’s initially packaged as an R/T with 496 hp and a 317-mile range, and the Scat Pack with 670 hp and a 260-mile range. A higher-performance Banshee will follow. For traditionalists, there’s also a twin-turbocharged inline-six engine available with 420 or 550 hp. Each engine is coupled to an 8-speed automatic transmission. Every Charger comes with all-wheel drive. Also new, whether it’s a two-door or a four-door, this Charger is a hatchback with a folding rear seat. The modern cabin makes use of screens for gauges, controls, and customization, with many performance settings available. 


Electric price: 
$59,595-$73,100, gas: $40,000-$70,000 (estimated)

Ford Expedition

The 2025 redesigned Ford Expedition has the same dimensions and overall look as the previous version. Fans will recognize the roomy interior and boxy proportions but notice slightly smoother exterior styling and more tech features inside. The instrument panel is a 24-inch digital display that sits between the bottom of the windshield and the top of a large center infotainment screen. A new Tremor trim adds off-road touches such as larger tires, a taller stance, skid plates, and a host of electronic off-roading aids originally introduced on the Ford Bronco. A host of active driver assistance features are standard, and Ford’s BlueCruise hands-free driving assistance feature is optional.

GMC Terrain

Redesigned for 2025, the GMC Terrain SUV is similar in size and mechanical details to its predecessor and to the related Chevrolet Equinox. It’s again powered by a 175-hp, 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that’s paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is standard on all versions of the Terrain at launch, though a front-wheel-drive version may arrive for the 2026 model year. The Terrain will be offered in three trims: Elevation, AT4, and Denali, each with its own styling touches. The AT4 is the off-road, adventure-focused version, while the Denali is positioned as the luxury choice. All share an interior that houses a vertically oriented 15-inch center infotainment screen, along with standard niceties like heated front seats and steering wheel. A comprehensive list of standard driver assistance and safety systems finally puts the Terrain on equal footing with its peers.

GMC Yukon

GMC is refreshing the Yukon for 2025. Updates for the large, three-row SUV include new headlights, grille, and lower front fascia. The modernized interior has a giant portrait-oriented 16.8-inch infotainment screen, while the reviled and distracting push-button gear selector has been replaced by a steering column stalk. The 355-hp, 5.3-liter V8 and 420-hp, 6.2-liter V8 carry over, and there’s a more powerful 305-hp, 3.0-liter inline-six turbodiesel. All three engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic, with both rear- and four-wheel drive available. Maximum towing capacity is 8,400 pounds. Two new trims, the AT4 Ultimate and Denali Ultimate, will be available. AEB with pedestrian and cyclist detection, BSW, and RCTW are now standard. The Super Cruise hands-free active driving assistance system, active parking assist, occupant detection system, and trailer-compatible blind spot warning will be available at a later date.

Honda Passport

For 2026 the Passport is more than just a smaller version of the Pilot. The two SUVs use the same 285-hp V6 engine and 10-speed automatic transmission, but the Passport now takes on a rugged, off-road persona with boxy, aggressive looks. A TrailSport trim amps that up with bolder styling and specific off-road features such as recovery points and skid plates. There’s no hybrid version of the Passport, which puts it behind some competitors when it comes to fuel economy. All-wheel drive is standard along with plenty of active safety features. Inside, there’s a Google-powered infotainment system (it’s still compatible with Apple CarPlay) and new seats, and the climate and audio are controlled by buttons and knobs rather than features on a screen. Honda says that everything from the suspension and steering ratio to the safety radars and cameras are improved compared with the outgoing model.

Honda Prelude

The Honda Prelude name is back, this time on a sporty-looking hybrid coupe. The Prelude was originally introduced in 1978. It gained fans for its impressive handling and cutting-edge technology over time, with innovations like four-wheel steering. Honda discontinued the Prelude in 2001, which means a full generation of drivers have never had the opportunity to own one. A sloping roofline and two-door design give the new Prelude a throwback look, similar to the Ford Mustang and Nissan Z. Although details are scarce, Honda says the new Prelude will have a dual-motor hybrid powertrain, likely a more powerful version of the one found in the smooth and efficient 
Accord
 or 
Civic Hybrid
, neither of which is offered as a coupe. The automaker also promises simulated shifts that will mimic a traditional automatic transmission.

Hyundai Ioniq 9

The Hyundai Ioniq 9 joins a growing number of electric three-row SUVs on the market. It can be configured to seat six or seven passengers; the six-passenger setup includes two reclining second-row captain’s chairs that swivel to face the third row. Stylistically, it’s a toned-down, more practical version of the futuristic Hyundai Seven concept. Still, Hyundai has gone big on aerodynamics, smoothing off everything from the door handles to the roof antenna, as well as the undercarriage. There’s a single-motor rear-wheel-drive version and a dual-motor all-wheel-drive one, as well as a 430-hp all-wheel-drive variant. Both get a large 110-kWh battery and a NACS-style charging port. Hyundai says the Ioniq 9 will tow 5,000 pounds.

The redesigned QX80 moves Infiniti’s full-sized SUV further upscale, with premium features to rival the most prestigious competitors, like large screens, Klipsch premium audio, second-row massaging seats, and the latest ProPilot Assist 2.1 active driving assistance system. Gaining 50 hp, the QX80 moves to a 450-hp, 3.5-liter turbocharged V6 engine instead of the previous V8, with a new nine-speed automatic transmission. It can be had in rear- or four-wheel drive. An adaptive suspension is available. Infiniti claims there’s more passenger and cargo space than before. Four trim levels see the comfort and convenience features climb precipitously, as the price likewise ascends well past six figures.

Lincoln Navigator

A number of cosmetic changes make the 2025 Navigator look a bit more modern, but under the skin it’s largely the same, with a powerful twin-turbo V6 engine, 10-speed automatic transmission, and roomy interior. Four-wheel drive is now standard. Improvements can mostly be seen inside, where a customizable 48-inch interactive display panel arcs across most of the dash. The digital display does duty as an instrument panel while underway, and when the vehicle is stopped, can be used for gaming and as a soothing background for the massaging seats. The rear tailgate features a new split design, with a short lower tailgate and an upper hatch Lincoln says makes it easier to load and unload groceries and the like without spilling them on the ground. Standard BlueCruise hands-free highway driving is another plus.

Lucid Gravity

Startup automaker Lucid’s second vehicle is the 2025 Gravity SUV. The automaker promises an extremely robust range of more than 440 miles, seating for up to seven passengers, a ton of cargo space, and a starting price below $80,000. If that’s not enough, Lucid says the Gravity will be able to sprint from 0 to 60 mph in under 3.5 seconds, which wouldn’t be too surprising considering the Air sedan’s outrageous performance. Unlike most newer SUVs, the Gravity trades aggressive exterior styling for flowing lines. Interior features include wide digital displays and even a guided meditation program. We doubt drivers will have much downtime, though, because the Gravity’s 900-volt design means it can add 200 miles in just 15 minutes at a high-speed public DC charger.

Mini Aceman

The new Aceman is a five-passenger, all-electric small crossover that complements the recently redesigned Mini Cooper and larger Countryman. Like all new Mini models, it’s an electric vehicle, part of the brand’s stated goal of being fully electric by 2030. Two electric powertrains, an 184-hp electric motor and a 218-hp electric motor, both in front-wheel drive, will be available. The availability of all-wheel drive has not been announced. According to the European Test Cycle, it will have up to 252 miles of electric range. We expect the Environmental Protection Agency’s estimated range to be shorter. The Aceman measures 160 inches long and 59 inches tall, which is more than 10 inches shorter than the Countryman. The interior looks like the redesigned Mini Cooper with the air vents and floating infotainment screen. Mini has not committed to offering the Aceman in the U.S., and the automaker tell CR this market is still under consideration.

Nissan Armada

For 2025, the redesigned Nissan Armada trades its thirsty V8 engine for a more efficient and powerful 425-hp twin-turbocharged V6 and gains an off-road-focused PRO-4X trim. It retains its 8,500-pound towing capacity but adds cargo room behind the second and third rows. Buyers can choose between rear- and four-wheel drive and seating for seven or eight. It shares its underlying design with the more luxurious Infiniti QX80. Nissan says the new Armada has a better ride and handling performance than its predecessor because of a stiffer frame and electric power steering. A wide touchscreen display and digital gauge cluster dominate the dashboard, while physical controls remain for climate control.

Nissan Murano

After almost a decade without a major update, Nissan has introduced the redesigned Murano, the brand’s midsized two-row SUV. The new Murano features smoother styling similar to Nissan’s all-electric Ariya. Nissan’s dependable V6 engine and idiosyncratic CVT have been replaced with a turbocharged four-cylinder and nine-speed automatic transmission. Although exterior and interior dimensions remain more or less the same, the new Murano benefits from a more robust suite of technology, including standard AEB, BSW, RCTW, automatic high beams, and ProPilot, an optional adaptive cruise control with a steering assist enhancement. Heated, electronically adjustable front seats are standard, and ventilated massaging seats are optional, as are a heated steering wheel, panoramic roof glass, and multicolor LED ambient lighting inside.

The 1500 REV looks every bit like a next-generation Ram pickup truck, with many familiar styling cues and features. There’s a single 654-hp electric powertrain with a choice of standard (350-mile range) or large (500-mile range) battery packs. The electrical system is compatible with 800-volt DC fast chargers for rapid replenishment, and it can route power to a house, the grid, or supply a worksite. It uses an independent rear suspension and will be available with an adjustable air suspension. There are five trims available. The new Tungsten top trim pushes the Ram’s luxury boundaries, with a more premium interior, a Klipsch stereo, and even massaging front seats. The 1500 REV will be available with a hands-free driver assistance system. After the electric-only 1500 REV goes on sale, it will be joined by the Ramcharger, an electrified full-sized Ram with a gas-fueled range extender.

Scout Terra & Traveler

The Scout Terra pickup truck and Scout Traveler SUV are prototypes of the first models to wear the Scout badge in 44 years, and they aim to mix new technology with what we think are the best kinds of old-school sensibilities. Scout is a division of Volkswagen focused on electric vehicles inspired by the 1970s International Scout 80 pickup truck and International Scout II SUV.


These rugged, retro EVs have a claimed 0 to 60 mph time of 3.5 seconds, a 7,000-pound tow capacity, and a 350-mile driving range. An optional “Harvester” version gets a gas-powered range extender for up to 500 miles of range. Scout owners will find real buttons and knobs for infotainment and climate control, traditional exterior door handles, and even an optional three-person front bench seat. Both Scout models are based on an all-new, rugged, body-on-frame design that’s not shared with other electric vehicles from Volkswagen and Audi. The automaker says that production will start in 2027 at Scout’s new factory in South Carolina.

True to its roots, the redesigned 4Runner is an off-road-capable SUV spun off a platform shared with the latest Tacoma pickup and other body-on-frame Toyota models. It’s larger than before, being both longer and wider. The SR5, TRD Sport, and TRD Sport Premium trims come with a 278-hp, 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine. Higher trims get the 326-hp, 2.4-liter turbocharged hybrid four-cylinder engine. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The 4Runner can be had in two-, four-, and full-time four-wheel drive. The interior features more modern amenities than before, with screen sizes dependent on trim level. The second-row seat tumbles forward to aid cargo versatility, and a third row is optional. And yes, the rear window on the liftgate powers up and down, a classic 4Runner characteristic.

The Volkswagen ID.7 midsized electric sedan uses the company’s modular electric drive (MEB) platform, shared with the ID.4 SUV. It’s sized like the retired Passat sedan, but it promises to be even roomier than that spacious four-door. And this latest electric car has a few tricks up its sleeve, such as a giant 15-inch center screen, a head-up display, an adjustable tinted glass roof, adaptive suspension, and available massaging seats. And although it may not be readily apparent, it’s a hatchback. The ID.7 uses a new electric drivetrain, with a 282-hp electric motor paired with a two-stage, one-speed transmission. A lithium-ion battery is packaged in the floor with a 77-kilowatt-hour capacity and a 170-kW charging capability. A larger 86-kWh version may be offered later. Made in Germany, the ID.7 goes on sale in 2024.

Volkswagen ID.Buzz


































































The Volkswagen ID.Buzz electric van is a nostalgic tribute to the classic Microbus, but it’s a decidedly modern vehicle without a direct rival. It measures about a foot less than traditional minivans, but the packaging benefits from not having an engine up front. The ID.Buzz uses either a single motor with 282 hp to drive the rear wheels or a dual-motor, 330-hp configuration with all-wheel drive. The cabin has a rather minimalist design, with neat horizontal vents, a 12.9-inch infotainment screen, and numerous charge points for mobile devices. There are many creature comforts on the base van, such as powered, heated, and ventilated front seats. Options include a heated windshield, a panoramic sunroof with electrochromic tinting, and a 14-speaker Harman Kardon stereo.

Unlike many other compact SUVs, there’s no hybrid version of the Tiguan. Most interior controls have been replaced by a central touchscreen, including touch-sensitive sliders for temperature. The steering wheel controls are still physical buttons, and there’s a multifunction knob in the center console for volume and drive modes. Options include multicolored interior accent lighting, a head-up display, massaging front seats, heated rear seats, and real wood and leather trim.
